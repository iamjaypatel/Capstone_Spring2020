## Your responsibilities

You have five responsibilities this term:

1. Give a 15 minute presentation on the work that you did during your internship or directed research with 5 minutes q&a.  See below Presentation organization.

2. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](##Final paper organization).

3. Fill in an anonymous peer review form for 5 presentations assigned to you.  See below Peer review organization.

4. CS 1950 students will send weekly reports to me and their respective advisors by email.

5. Attend classes regularly.

## Presentation organization

1. All students must schedule a presentation date on this DOODLE POLL (to be linked) until next THURSDAY (16 JANUARY). You are to enter your name and select a single preferred date. There are 2 slots per day and if the slots fill up, you will have to choose another day. It is first come first serve so if you want a particular date, please sign up as early as possible.
2. Please review [the lecture on presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/Capstone_Lecture4_Presentations.pdf) and [these slides]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/Capstone_Lecture5_Supplemental.pdf) before giving your presentation.  You might also want to look at [the Peer Review Form]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/review_form.txt).  The review form will remind you of what you are being assessed on.
3. Presenters must submit their presentation slides to courseweb the day before, by Thursday midnight.  The plan is to have your slide files ready on the in-class computer so that we can transition faster between presentations.  The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  If you plan to use other presentation software, you are responsible for bringing your laptop and any adapters to connect to the classroom A/V system.

## Peer review organization

Fill in an anonymous peer review form for 5 presentations assigned to you.  Please use the [Peer Review Form]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/review_form.txt) on this website.  The form should be submitted to courseweb by Saturday midnight the day after the presentation with the file name PresenterName_ReviewerID.txt.  You can view the presentation slides on TopHat while writing the review.  Please review [tips for writing a good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).

The median score from the peer review forms will be used as a data point to grade the presentations.

[Here is the PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/capstone_assignments_public.pdf) for the peer review assignments.

You will get your respective reviewer IDs by individual email.

## Final paper organization

Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see [Final Paper]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper) on this website.  PDF format is preferred.  The paper should be submitted to courseweb by midnight of 17 APRIL.  Please consider submitting the paper earlier to get feedback.

[Please read these slides]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/Capstone_Lecture5_Supplemental.pdf) before writing the report.  Most of the things I said about presentations is also relevant to the report, and also there is an example outline of the report on the final slide.  Feel free to use your own organization if you'd like but it should contain all the major components.
